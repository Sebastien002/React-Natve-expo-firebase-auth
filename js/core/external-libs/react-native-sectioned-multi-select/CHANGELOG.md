# Changelog

## 0.5.2 - 2018-07-10
### Fixed
    - Added `keyboardShouldPersistTaps` props where needed
### Added
    - Add `selectedItemText` and `selectedSubItemText` styles (previously only the parent view style was editable when selected).
    
## 0.5.1 - 2018-06-29
### Added
    - Add `chipRemoveIconComponent`, this icon wasn't user replaceable before.
    - Add `filterItems` function prop. It will replace the filter used for searching. parameters are `searchTerm`, `items`, `props`. You need to return an array of item objects. (example in `exampleapp/App.js`).

## 0.5.0 - 2018-06-12
### Added
    - Add `expandDropDowns` prop. Set to true to expand all parent dropdowns (when using `showDropDowns`).
    - Add `animateDropDowns` prop. Set to false to not use LayoutAnimation when toggling the dropdowns.
    - Add `customLayoutAnimation` prop. Use your own LayoutAnimation preset or custom layout animation object for the toggling of dropdowns.
    - Add `selectLabelNumberOfLines` prop.
    - Add `renderSelectText` function that receives props. This allows you to fully customize what the select label says and when, overriding `selectText`, `selectedText` etc.
### Changed
    - `numberOfLines` is now `itemNumberOfLines`, to avoid confusion.
    - There were serious perf issues for things like toggling dropdowns with larger lists. To mitigate this, the sub items have been moved inside of the parent items and some functions have been rafactored or moved. The only noticeable difference should be that the parent item's `itemSeparator` shows at the bottom of the group of items, rather than always being directly below the parent item.
### Fixed
    - Cast keyExtractor ids to string #31
    - Should be generally faster...

## 0.4.7 - 2018-05-07
### Changed
    - Removed lodash dependency: replaced get and reject functions with internal functions.

## 0.4.4 - 2018-04-13
### Added
    - `alwaysShowSelectText` prop - if true the select label won't show the amount selected + `selectedText` or the name of the selected item if only one items is selected. Not applied when `single` is true as single shows the `dispayKey` on the select label only. #23
    - `searchAdornment` prop - function that receives the text of the search input, and is output on the right hand side of the search input. Useful if you need to do something with the search text like add a new item.
